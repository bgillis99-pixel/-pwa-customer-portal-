# PWA Icons - Quick Setup

## 🚀 Super Simple Method (30 seconds)

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser (double-click the file)
2. Click "Download 192x192" and "Download 512x512"
3. Save both PNG files in this directory
4. Done! Your PWA icons are ready

## 🎨 Icon Design

**Simple, clean design for investor presentations:**
- White background (professional, clean)
- Blue "CARB" text (#1A3C5E)
- Green wave at bottom (#00A651) - text sits on it like a cloud
- Rounded corners for modern app icon look

## 📱 Files Needed

```
/public/icons/
├── icon-192.png    ← 192x192px (required)
├── icon-512.png    ← 512x512px (required)
└── favicon.ico     ← Optional browser icon
```

## ✅ After Generating

Your icons will:
- Show on mobile home screens when users "Add to Home Screen"
- Display in app stores and PWA catalogs
- Represent your brand professionally
- Be easy to change later as your branding evolves

## 🔄 Easy to Update Later

This is a simple starter design. When you're ready to update:
1. Edit `icon-template.svg` with new design
2. Re-run `generate-icons.html`
3. Replace the PNG files
4. Redeploy

No code changes needed!

## 🛠️ Alternative: Use Your Logo

If you want to use your full NorCal CARB logo instead:
1. Open your logo in any image editor
2. Create a square canvas (512x512 or 192x192)
3. Add white or green background
4. Center your logo
5. Export as PNG
6. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
